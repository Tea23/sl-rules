# Welcome to ScoutLink Discourse
ScoutLink Discourse is a discussion forum for Scouts and Guides around the world, part of the ScoutLink Network complimenting our real time IRC chat, Minecraft, voice chat, and other services. These rules and guidelines set out some dos and don'ts about using Discourse.

## Rule 0: ScoutLink general rules still apply
The rules laid out on https://www.scoutlink.net/rules/ still apply to this forum, except those which only apply to IRC and Minecraft (such as idling). You must always remember your Scout/Guide Law & Promise/Oath when interacting with the forum. As Discourse posts are permanent and public, you should take extra care and ensure that you do not say anything in a post that you wouldn't say in front of a Cub Scout.

## Rule 1: Stay on Topic
You can open a thread on just about any topic. When participating in a thread you should ensure that you are contributing positively to the discussion at hand. If you wish to discuss something else, you can open a new thread.

### Rule 1a: Does it need resurrecting?
Threads on Discourse do not expire, and it is possible to refer back to threads opened years in the past. If you intend to discuss something from these threads, you should consider whether it is necessary to post in the same thread. 'Resurrecting' dead threads can sometimes be confusing. It is usually better to start a new thread.

### Rule 2a: Low effort posts
Posts containing one or two words are typically not conducive to a good discussion. Your posts should contribute positively to the discussion at hand. When posting, ask yourself if your post is informative, constructive, funny, interesting, or any combination of the aforementioned.

## Rule 2: Personally identifiable information
Most posts on Discourse are public and can be read by anyone, and they don't get deleted over time. As such they can be referred to by parents, Leaders/volunteers, young people (eg Cub Scouts) and journalists.

Posts which identify, or can lead to the identification of a member of Scouting* without their knowledge or consent are strictly prohibited.

Any complaints or safeguarding issues should be flagged up to your National Scout Organisation or a ScoutLink Coordinator, as appropriate.

## Rule 3: Operator discretion
The rules above cannot cover everything. If an operator deems a thread or post to be inappropriate they have full discretion to take action that they see is appropriate. Users are reminded that use of the ScoutLink network **is a privilege, not a right**.

## Rule 4: Have fun, learn, and teach!
Discourse is an excellent ideas sharing platform. Use it to your advantage! Share Scouting stories, ideas, campfire songs, games - use the platform to make your Scouting better, and to help improve Scouting for others!
