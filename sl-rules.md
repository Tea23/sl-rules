# Welcome to ScoutLink Discourse
ScoutLink Discourse is a discussion forum for Scouts and Guides around the world, part of the ScoutLink Network complimenting our real time IRC chat, Minecraft, voice chat, and other services. These rules and guidelines set out some dos and don'ts about using Discourse.

##Rule 0: ScoutLink general rules still apply
The rules laid out on https://www.scoutlink.net/rules/ still apply to this forum, except those which only apply to IRC and Minecraft (such as idling). You must always remember your Scout/Guide Law & Promise/Oath when interacting with the forum. As Discourse posts are permanent and public, you should take extra care and ensure that you do not say anything in a post that you wouldn't say in front of a Cub Scout.

##Rule 1: Stay on Topic
You can open a thread on just about any topic. When participating in a thread you should ensure that you are contributing positively to the discussion at hand. If you wish to discuss something else, you can open a new thread.

###Rule 1a: Does it need resurrecting?
Threads on Discourse do not expire, and it is possible to refer back to threads opened years in the past. If you intend to discuss something from these threads, you should consider whether it is necessary to post in the same thread. 'Resurrecting' dead threads can sometimes be confusing. It is usually better to start a new thread.

###Rule 2a: Low effort posts
Posts containing one or two words are typically not conducive to a good discussion. Your posts should contribute positively to the discussion at hand. When posting, ask yourself if your post is informative, constructive, funny, interesting, or any combination of the aforementioned.

##Rule 2: Personally identifiable information
Volunteers in Scouting can often have complaints about personnel in their local Scouting organisations, and it is natural to seek advice from other Scouts. While this is acceptable, remember that Discourse is a permanent and public discussion forum. As such, discussing cases which can lead to the identification of individuals outside of ScoutLink is prohibited. If you have concerns about a volunteer or other related personnel involved in Scouting local to you, you should contact the relevant people at your National Scouting Organisation.

Allegations and accusations about volunteers in Scouting, and related to Scouting, must not be made on this forum.

A valid concern about a volunteer may be something along the lines of, "I have a brand new Assistant Scout Leader in my Troop, however she isn't very confident at coming up with ideas - how can I encourage her?"

Safeguarding concerns must never be raised on the forum. Always **contact your NSO** in these instances.

##Rule 3: Operator discretion
The rules above cannot cover everything. If an operator deems a thread or post to be inappropriate they have full discretion to take action that they see is appropriate. Users are reminded that use of the ScoutLink network **is a privilege, not a right**.

##Rule 4: Have fun, learn, and teach!
Discourse is an excellent ideas sharing platform. Use it to your advantage! Share Scouting stories, ideas, campfire songs, games - use the platform to make your Scouting better, and to help improve Scouting for others!
